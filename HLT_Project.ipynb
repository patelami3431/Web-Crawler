              "  'subscribenutritionevidence basedthe beginner s guide to the   diet written by adda bjarnadottir  ms on may   intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves regular fasting.the   diet  also known as the fast diet  is currently the most popular intermittent fasting diet.it was popularized by british journalist michael mosley.it s called the   diet because five days of the week are normal eating days  while the other two restrict calories to   per day.because there are no requirements about which foods to eat but rather when you should eat them  this diet is more of a lifestyle.many people find this way of eating to be easier to stick to than a traditional calorie restricted diet   .this article explains everything you need to know about the   diet.how to do the   dietshare on pinterestthe   diet is actually very simple to explain.for five days per week  you eat normally and don t have to think about restricting calories.then  on the other two days  you reduce your calorie intake to a quarter of your daily needs.',\n",
              "  'this is about  calories per day for women  and  for men.you can choose whichever two days of the week you prefer  as long as there is at least one non fasting day in between them.one common way of planning the week is to fast on mondays and thursdays  with two or three small meals  then eat normally for the rest of the week.it s important to emphasize that eating  normally  does not mean you can eat anything.',\n",
              "  'if you binge on junk food  then you probably won t lose any weight  and you may even gain weight.you should eat the same amount of food as if you hadn t been fasting at all.summary the   diet involves eating normally for five days per week  then restricting your calorie intake to   calories on the other two days.health benefits of intermittent fastingthere are very few studies on the   diet specifically.however  there are plenty of studies on intermittent fasting in general  which show impressive health benefits     .one important benefit is that intermittent fasting seems to be easier to follow than continuous calorie restriction  at least for some people     .also  many studies have shown that different types of intermittent fasting may significantly reduce insulin levels       .one study showed that the   diet caused weight loss similar to regular calorie restriction.',\n",
              "  'it may also improve blood lipids.the   diet for weight lossif you need to lose weight  the   diet can be very effective when done right.this is mainly because the   eating pattern helps you consume fewer calories.therefore  it is very important not to compensate for the fasting days by eating much more on the non fasting days.intermittent fasting does not cause more weight loss than regular calorie restriction if total calories are matched     .that said  fasting protocols similar to the   diet have shown a lot of promise in weight loss studies a recent review found that modified alternate day fasting led to weight loss of    over the course of   weeks   .in the same study  participants lost    of their waist circumference  meaning that they lost a lot of harmful belly fat.intermittent fasting causes a much smaller reduction in muscle mass when compared to weight loss with conventional calorie restriction     .intermittent fasting is even more effective when combined with exercise  such as endurance or strength training   .summary the   diet should be very effective for weight loss if done correctly.',\n",
