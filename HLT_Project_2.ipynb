      "Feeling healthy and feeling good about yourself is not a luxury – it’s an absolute necessity.The very low calorie diet is a doctor-supervised diet that allows 600-800 calories per day. Most very low calorie diets consist of high-protein shake containing vitamin and mineral supplements to meet recommended daily requirements. The diet is used for short-term weight loss (up to six months).The very low calorie diet is prescribed by a physician on a case to case basis to promote rapid weight loss in patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher. It can be prescribes to patients with Body Mass Index between 27 and 30 if they have medical complications due to overweight.The very low calorie diet is a very effective treatment for rapid weight loss and allows patients to lose three to five pounds per week. It can be used to improve obesity-related medical conditions such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes.The minor side effects of the very low calorie diet include fatigue, nausea, constipation or diarrhea. The serious side effect of the very low calorie diet is gallstone formation caused by rapid weight loss. It can be prevented by some medicines. To ensure the patients are not experiencing any serious side effects, doctors must monitor patients regularly, about twice a week.Low calorie diets allowing 800-1000 calories a day have shown to be equally effective in helping patients lose weight. This is probable due to the fact that it is easier for patients to comply with less restrictive diets.The very low calorie diet can cause large amount of weight loss and improvement in health in obese patients. The very low calorie diet always requires medical supervision as it can be misused by the patient and lead to health risks. You must seek medical help before trying any very low calorie diet because dangerous side effects can occur if the diet is abused.Your email address will not be published.
